				<h2>Where I started coding...</h2>
				<p>I studied at Lipa City Colleges, batch 2012, taking up Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. And luckily, graduated as Cum Laude. I never imagined myself being a programmer. I dreamt to be an engineer, and I reached my dream, I became an engineer. Not a civil, mechanical, nor electrical engineer, but a <b>software engineer</b>. At first, I thought that will never like this one, but hey, I realized that programming is so damn fun. :)</p>
